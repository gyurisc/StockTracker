The goal of this skill is to implement a treu test-driven development workflow. This means: 

1. Writing the simplest test for ONE discrete piece of functionality.
2. Running the test and watching it fail.
3. Writing the minimum amount of code to make the test pass.
4. Write the minimal amount of code needed to make the test pass.
5. Running the test and watching it pass.
6. Refactoring the code if necessary, while keeping the tests green.

Repeat this cycle for each new piece of functionality until the feature is complete.

Rembmeber to never: 
a
1. Write the entire test upfront 
2. Implement more than one discrete piece of functionality at a time.
